# Java dependency review — 2026-11-13

Baseline: upstream/master `5d27187e587a7b91e82361e3c52b05eb5d933dd3`, branch
`ci/modernization`. Upstream SHA, open PRs #322/#323 and recent failed CI runs
were rechecked before implementation. No remote changes were made.

## Selected toolchain and direct dependencies

JDK 25 LTS was selected after compiling and running OWLAPI/HermiT tests with
JetBrains Runtime 25.0.4.1. Maven 3.9.16 is pinned by the official only-script
wrapper 3.3.4 and its distribution SHA-256 (computed after verification against
Central's SHA-512). Enforcer checks both Java and Maven versions.

Current stable Maven Central versions were checked during this change:

| Dependency | Version | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OWLAPI distribution | 5.5.1 | Ontology loading and processing |
| Protege XML catalog | 1.0.5 | Existing catalog mapper |
| SnakeYAML | 2.7 | Safe, plain-data YAML configuration |
| SLF4J API/provider/bridges | 2.0.20 | Logging; 2.1 alpha intentionally excluded |
| JUnit Jupiter | 6.1.3 | Test only |
| HermiT | 1.4.5.519 | Test only, latest published version |

Spring Boot, its parent/plugin, Spring DI, Logback and direct JetBrains annotations
were removed. Guava is needed transitively by OWLAPI, managed at 33.8.0-jre
(newer than PR #323's 33.7.1). Commons Lang is no longer a direct dependency;
3.22.0 is managed should it appear transitively (newer than PR #322's 3.18.0).
The old Log4j 1.2 dependency from XML catalog is excluded and replaced with
`log4j-over-slf4j`. Maven lifecycle plugins have explicit stable versions.

## Security review

Captured before/after dependency trees distinguish direct and transitive edges.
An OSV batch query covered all 94 resolved application and test artifacts.
Initial findings in transitive Jackson 2.16.1 and test-only Mime4j 0.7.2 were
resolved with the current Jackson 2.x BOM 2.23.0 and Mime4j 0.8.15. Jackson 3
uses different coordinates/APIs and cannot replace OWLAPI's Jackson 2 imports.
The final query returned no known advisories for these 94 coordinates/versions.
This is a dated advisory lookup, not proof of absence of vulnerabilities; it
excludes Maven plugin internals, the JDK and external CLI reasoners.

Other transitives follow the selected OWLAPI/HermiT releases; wholesale major
upgrades of their internal APIs are not implied by the direct dependency update.
HermiT's older Axiom dependencies remain test-only. Their compatibility is
covered by a synthetic consistency and unsatisfiable-class probe, not a full SOMA
classification. No outstanding OSV finding is suppressed.

Local evidence (intentionally ignored): `build/local-plans/a2-before.txt`,
`a2-after.txt`, `a2-osv.json`, `a2-build.log`, `a2-final-build.log`.

Reproduce the dependency inventory from the repository root:

```sh
bash ./mvnw -B -ntp -f scripts/java/pom.xml org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.8.1:tree
```

A3 subsequently replaced the Protege catalog implementation with a strict JDK
XML parser, removing `org.protege.xmlcatalog` and its `log4j-over-slf4j` bridge.
Jackson Databind is now declared directly for manifest/report JSON; its version
is unchanged under the already reviewed Jackson BOM. The Maven verify lifecycle
uses the pinned `exec-maven-plugin` 3.5.0 to launch the packaged CLI. These plugin
internals remain outside the application advisory scan described above.

A4 still owns workflow security and obsolete actions. Hosted CI has not been
triggered here.
